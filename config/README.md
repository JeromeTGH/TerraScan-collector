## Hidden (need to create) : "private" directory and "private/private.yaml" file, in "config" folder

<u>Nota</u> : there is an example of this configuration file here, named "private-sample.yaml" ; this file must be copied, completed, renamed as "private.yaml", and moved to the dedicated "/config/private" directory, so that this app could works proprely.

Path of final config file = ***/config/private/private.yaml***
